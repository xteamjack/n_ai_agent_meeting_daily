I am trying to build AI based meeting agent using daily.co. I have the basic configuration PoC build and testing as summarized below
- daily.co configured
- a webhook built and setup on local server and configured over nginx at url https://digihire.ai/daily/webhook
- a dummy agent is created which joins the meeting, no other activitiy
- able to start the meeting with dummy agent as one of the participants along with other human participants
- On completion of the meeting, dowload and store teh meeting recording in local drive

Now I want to extent the functionality to give the agent brain, eyes, ears, and mouth so that I can organize, moderate and complete the agent. In this regard I am exploring pipecat cloud hosted by daily.co

My ask, read daily.co pipecat cloud documentation (at https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/introduction) and give me instruction on to setup and configure?

I already tried once and failed due to too many intricate things which keep failing due to lack of proper document. This make it a tedious trial and error. I request you to start with big picture, segmented plan so that we can achive one aspect at a time from the big picture. But for implement, give me instruction on step at a time aligned to the current segment so that is it easy to course correct or rollback. After completing that step will ask for next step to complete that segment. On completing the segment we will move to the next segment
